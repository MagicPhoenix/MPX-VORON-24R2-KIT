# Print Guide

These printed parts are based on R2 version.

### From Offical Repository 

For the plug-panel, you need to print the filtered one
[ [power_inlet_filtered.stl\]](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2/blob/Voron2.4/STLs/Skirts/power_inlet_filtered.stl)

### From VoronUsers Mod

We use sexbolt endstop instead.  

Follow this : [Microswitch Z Endstop PCB](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/hartk1213/Voron2.4_SexBolt_ZEndstop)

### For Canbus 

Print `U2C_Mount`,`Y_endstop_cable_gland_A`,`Y_endstop_cable_gland_B`

Afterburner: `CW1_EBB36_Mount`

Stealthburner: `CW2_EBB36_Mount`

`U2C_Mount` needs a stock din clip.   

### Additional parts

All file here 

##### LRS-200-24 Mount

You need to print `PSU_MOUNT_B_x2`, `PSU_MOUNT_A_x2.stl`, `PSU_DIN_MOUNT_x4 v1.stl`, and should skip the offical printed parts for LRS-200-24.  

This may be a bit troublesome, but it's definitely worth it for a clean electrical room

##### Breakout PCB Mount

We are using a modified DIN rail clip to mount it directly

#####  Modified Raspberry mount [Optional]

This rpi mount slightly moved a few millimeters in the vertical direction.

##### Toolboard Mount

There're two versions, one is for Afterburner, another one for Stealthburner.
